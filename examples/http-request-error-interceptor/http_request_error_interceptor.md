# Request error interceptor

A `RequestErrorInterceptor` is used to handle the errors that occurred in the interceptor pipeline execution. 
When an error is returned from a `RequestInterceptor` service, the interceptor pipeline execution jumps to the
nearest `RequestErrorInterceptor`. However, if there is no `RequestErrorInterceptor` in the pipeline, then, 
the error response is returned to the client without executing the actual resource in the target service.
