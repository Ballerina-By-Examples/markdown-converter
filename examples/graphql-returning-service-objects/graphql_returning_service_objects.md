# Returning service objects

A GraphQL resource function can return service objects. The returning
service objects are mapped to the `OBJECT` type in the GraphQL schema. Each
resource function in the returned service object becomes a field in the
created `OBJECT` type.<br/><br/>
For more information on the underlying package, see the
[`graphql` package](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).
