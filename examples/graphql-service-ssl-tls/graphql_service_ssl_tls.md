# Service - SSL/TLS

You can use the GraphQL listener to connect to or interact with an HTTPS client.
Provide the `graphql:ListenerSecureSocket` configurations to the server to
expose an HTTPS connection.<br/><br/>
For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [GraphQL module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).
